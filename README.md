	11、看到你的手我就能安心，陪你天涯海角。
　　在每天达到会场之后，城市朗读《门生规》，全场三千多人，朗读典范，有些以至过目成诵，我回顾最深的即是“双亲呼，应勿缓；双亲命，行勿懒”这是为人子的原因。有一位讲师说，中华保守文明用一个字来详细那即是“孝”字，两个字即是“品德”二字，再有一位讲师说过，《门生规》不只仅是童子的规，更是做人的规，真实，《门生规》中很多都是做人处世的原因。周旋双亲要“双亲呼，应勿缓；双亲命，行勿懒”；周旋伯仲伙伴要“兄道友，弟道恭；伯仲睦，孝在中”；周旋本人的动作要“朝夙起，夜眠迟；老易至，惜此时”；与他人相与则要“但凡人，皆须爱；天同覆，地同载”之类做人处世的原因不计其数。

6, unavoidably suffered setbacks in life, is the rainbow after the rain;
Life is suffering, after a storm comes a calm, sunny.
For three days, the goldfish is in the brink of death, breathing.
The pain in my heart, and also by a point to spread around, to spread.
Suddenly I think goldfish just was in retaliation for me!!!!!!!
In the torture me!!!!!!!
So I live in retaliation for who?
No, I live have no hatred, I live to appreciate!
Someone once asked me, why to live, I said, if it is for their own, in order to enjoy, that I would have not lived.
I'm not noble, but in this world, I am worried about there are too many and too much to worry about the people I, let I can't give up.
Rising up through the layers around me is the invisible web, I tried to break through them, but loathe to give up, afraid to hurt their loved ones and friends.
